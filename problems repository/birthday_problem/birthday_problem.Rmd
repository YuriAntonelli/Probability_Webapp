## Birthday Problem
Given a set of *n* randomly chosen people, what is the probability that at least 2 share the same birthday?
It can be shown that it's enough to have only 23 people for a probability of 50%

### Analytical Solution
Assuming that all years have 365 days and independence between birthdays:

If \( n \geq 365 \), then \( P(\text{at least 2 have the same birthday}) = 1 \)

If \( n < 365 \), then 
\[ P(\text{no one has the same birthday}) = \frac{{365 \cdot 364 \cdot 363 \cdot \ldots \cdot (365 - n + 1)}}{{365^n}} \]

Therefore, 
\[ P(\text{at least 2 have the same birthday}) = 1 - P(\text{no one has the same birthday}) \]

### Simulated Solution
```{r}
birthday <- function(n_sim, n_pop) {
  
  # 1) Store all the simulations in a matrix
  store_matrix <- matrix(sample(1:365, n_sim * n_pop, replace = TRUE), nrow = n_pop, ncol = n_sim)
  store_matrix <- apply(store_matrix, 2, sort)
  
  # 2) create a vector of length equal to the number of simulations,
  #    to be filled with 1 and 0
  counter <- numeric(n_sim)
  
  for (i in seq_along(counter)) {
    # check each simulation with the next one, as we sorted before
    if (anyDuplicated(store_matrix[, i])) {
      counter[i] <- 1
    }
  }
  
  # 3) probability = sum of 1's / length(counter)
  prob <- mean(counter)
  prob
}
